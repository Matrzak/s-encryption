### s-encryption (simple encryption)

> A Java implementation of well-known hashing/encrypting algorithms like SHA or MD family. This project also constaint a pseudo hashing functions like based on key string converter to hashed message

# TODO

- [x] MD5
- [x] SHA1
- [ ] key/value algorithm
- [ ] add possibility to input a text
- [ ] choose your algorithm :)
